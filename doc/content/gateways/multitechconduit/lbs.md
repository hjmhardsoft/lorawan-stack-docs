On Multitech gateways, only CUPS **or** LNS can be configured. Configuring CUPS will automatically configure LNS, so to use {{% tts %}}, just follow the instructions for [Connecting CUPS]({{< ref "/gateways/lora-basics-station/cups" >}}).

Be sure to select **CUPS** in the **Credentials** dropdown.

After entering the CUPS configuration, click the **Submit** button, and then click **Save and Apply**. The gateway will apply the changes.
